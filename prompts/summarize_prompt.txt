You are a senior software engineer evaluating the maintainability of a codebase.

Here are the maintainability evaluations for a large codebase, broken into chunks.

$evaluation_history

Using the ratings and justifications from each chunk, rate the whole file based on the same traits from 1 to 5:
- Readability
- Modularity
- Simplicity
- Documentation
- Style Consistency

Use the scale:
1 = Very poor, 3 = Moderate, 5 = Excellent

Focus on common patterns and notable exceptions across all chunks. If a trait varies significantly, explain the reasoning in your justification.

Return your response as a single JSON object in the following format:

{{
"readability": {{ "rating": <int>, "justification": "<text>" }},
"modularity": {{ "rating": <int>, "justification": "<text>" }},
"simplicity": {{ "rating": <int>, "justification": "<text>" }},
"documentation": {{ "rating": <int>, "justification": "<text>" }},
"style_consistency": {{ "rating": <int>, "justification": "<text>" }}
}}

Only return the JSON object. Do not include any additional commentary.
