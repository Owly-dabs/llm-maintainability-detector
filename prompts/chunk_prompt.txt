You are a senior software engineer evaluating the maintainability of a {language} codebase.

Below are evaluations from previous chunks to provide context:

{evaluation_history}

Now, evaluate the following chunk of code. Rate each trait from 1 to 5:
- Readability
- Modularity
- Simplicity
- Documentation
- Style Consistency

Use the scale:
1 = Very poor, 3 = Moderate, 5 = Excellent

CHUNK:
```{language}
{chunk}
```
Return your response as a single JSON object in the following format:

{{
"readability": {{ "rating": <int>, "justification": "<text>" }},
"modularity": {{ "rating": <int>, "justification": "<text>" }},
"simplicity": {{ "rating": <int>, "justification": "<text>" }},
"documentation": {{ "rating": <int>, "justification": "<text>" }},
"style_consistency": {{ "rating": <int>, "justification": "<text>" }}
}}

Only return the JSON object. Do not include any additional commentary.
